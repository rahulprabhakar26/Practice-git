      Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the
      given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child
      of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated
      to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working tree, in
      which case HEAD is "detached" as described in git-checkout[1]).
